# SAML2 Single Sign On for Preside

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pixl8/preside-ext-saml2-sso.svg?branch=stable "Stable")](https://travis-ci.org/pixl8/preside-ext-saml2-sso)

This extension provides single sign on for Preside applications using [SAML2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0).

In its current form, it allows your website, for front-end website users, to be used as an Identity Provider (IDP) and for the Preside application (either front or backend) to act as a Service Provider (SP) with an external IDP.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/pixl8/preside-ext-saml2-sso/wiki) for full documentation.
